Basic Installation
==================

The standard way to install this package is:

  1.  Download the lolfs source code and extract it:
      tar -zxvf lolfs-VERSION.tar.gz

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure'
      The "configure" script inspects your system and creates
      a "Makefile" which you may then run by typing:
     `make' to compile the package for your system.

  3. Type `sudo make install' or `make install' as root to install
     the programs, headers and the library "liblolfs".

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directories by typing `make clean'.

  5. To remove lolfs completely from the system after 'make install',
     type `sudo make uninstall' or `make uninstall' as root.
     (That would be sad though :(



Compilers and Options
=====================

	Type: ./configure --help


Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

        I don't know. I have only compiled this on Linux
        I guess it will compile on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris
        and perhaps Mac OS X


   Have fun with lolfs!
