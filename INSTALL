Basic Installation
==================

The standard way to install this package is:

  1.  Download the lolfs source code and extract it:
      tar -zxvf lolfs-VERSION.tar.gz

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code
      and type: `./configure'

      The "configure" script inspects your system and creates
      a "Makefile" which you may then run (next step).

  3. Type: `make' to compile the package for your system.

  4. Optionally you may also check the compiled package
     by typing: `make check'
     This will execute a testsuite, which is a couple of
     test programs to verify if the build was succesful.

  5. Type `sudo make install' (or as root user `make install')
     to install the final product: the programs, header files
      and the library 'liblolfs'.

  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directories by typing `make clean'.

  7. To remove lolfs completely from the system after 'make install',
     type `sudo make uninstall' (or `make uninstall' as root).

  8. What to do next?
     	  - Try creating your first container by typing:
	    'lol fs -s 10M test.db'
	    (This creates a 10 Mb container).

	  - Verify the space of the container, by typing:
	    'lol df test.db'

	  - Copy some files into the container using command:
	    'lol cp file.jpg test.db' 
	    (Just replace the 'file.jpg' with some actual file
	    you have)

	  - Check that the file is inside the container, type:
	    'lol ls test.db'

	  - etc..



Compilers and Options
=====================

	Type: ./configure --help


Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

        I don't know. I have only compiled this on Linux
        I guess it will compile on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris
        and perhaps Mac OS X



   I hope you find some use for this little app :)


   Have fun with lolfs!
