Basic Installation
==================

The standard way to install this package is:

  [1]. Download the lolfs source code and extract it:
       tar -zxvf lolfs-VERSION.tar.gz

  [2]. [OPTIONAL STEP] If you have autoconf package version 2.69 or
                       higher installed, you may initialize the
                       configuration - this is optional:
       In the lolfs-VERSION directory, type: ./autogen.sh

  [3]. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code
       and type: `./configure'
       The "configure" script inspects your system and creates
       a "Makefile" which you may then run (next step).

  [4]. Type: `make' to compile the package for your system.

  [5]. Optionally you may also check the compiled package
       by typing: `make check'
       This will execute a testsuite, which has a couple of
       test programs which verify if the build was succesful.

  [6]. Type `sudo make install' (or as root user `make install')
       to install the final product: the programs, header files
       and the library 'liblolfs'.
       Alternatively -to install smaller 'stripped' versions-
       type: `make install-strip'.

  [7]. To clean the program binaries and object files from the
       source code directories, type `make clean'.

  [8]. To remove lolfs completely from the system after 'make install',
       type `sudo make uninstall' (or `make uninstall' as root).

  [9]. What to do next?

     	  - Try creating your first container by typing:
	    'lol fs -s 10M test.db'
	    (This creates a 10 Mb container).

	  - Verify the space of the container, by typing:
	    'lol df test.db'

	  - Copy some files into the container using command:
	    'lol cp file.jpg test.db' 
	    (Just replace the 'file.jpg' with some actual file
	    you have)

	  - Check that the file is inside the container, type:
	    'lol ls test.db'

	  - etc..



Compilers and Options
=====================

	Type: ./configure --help


Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

        I don't know. I have only compiled this on Linux
        I guess it will compile on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris
        and perhaps Mac OS X


   I hope you find some use for this little app :)


   Have fun with lolfs!
