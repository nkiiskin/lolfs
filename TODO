- Version 0.12 notes:

- Endianess questions & portability of containers from
  BIG- to LITTLE endian. Must be fixed.
  (LE containers are currently not readable in BE systems
   and vice versa).

- lol cp: Should check if container has enough space
  BEFORE trying to copy into it.

- Missing interface functions: opendir() etc.

-  When using removable storage directly to create
   lolfs "filesystem" on it, currently only Linux
   is supported.
   (Usually lolfs storage is created as a normal
    file in the filesystem, so this should not be
    a huge problem)

- Thread safety: NOT thread safe as of v0.12.
  Should add file lock

- sub-directories?
  Maybe later
