- Version 0.30 notes:

- Endianess questions & portability of containers from
  BIG- to LITTLE endian. Must be fixed.
  (LE containers are currently not readable in BE systems
   and vice versa).

- lol cp: cannot copy between containers yet,
          just between one container and host
          filesystem.

- Missing interface functions: opendir() etc.

-  When using removable storage directly to create
   lolfs "filesystem" on it, currently only Linux
   is supported.
   (Usually lolfs storage is created as a normal
    file in the filesystem, so this should not be
    a huge problem)

- Add more tests to the testsuite

- Fix lol_cc.c --> buffer the i/o
- lol_file.h: add last free nentry index to sb
- lolfs.c: buffer lol_free_nentry
- lol_cc.c: When invalid file found -> try to get more details

- Thread safety: NOT thread safe as of v0.30.
  (Should add transaction locking)

- sub-directories?
  Maybe later
