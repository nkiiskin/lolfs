        <pre><code>Liblolfs - Little Object List (LOL) filesystem - by Niko Kiiskinen


    Please see file 'INSTALL' for detailed installation instructions
</code></pre>

<p>Manifesto</p>

<pre><code> I enjoy (re-)inventing wheels, here is another excr.. example.

 Lolfs is a container file. It means that it is a file (stored
 in your computer somewhere) which has other files inside it.

 Once you create a lol container file (using the included
 'mkfs.lolfs' utility or lol_mkfs API function), you can
 then use the lolfs API explained in &lt;lolfs.h&gt; to create,
 modify and delete files in this container.

 The installation package also contains a program "lol",
 which may be used to do the common file operations:



mkfs.lolfs program:
===================


            "mkfs.lolfs" creates a container file.


            It takes 3 parameters:
            - block size: the number of bytes a "block" has
                          (this is a number which you can choose
                           freely. Try to choose it as average file size
                           to gain best performance).

            - number of blocks: the number of data blocks. This depends
                                on how big container you want.
                                Try like 50000 first and try it

            - filename: this is just the name which you like to use
                        as the name of the container file. Ex:
                        'mycontainer'

             Use like: "mkfs.lolfs  100  5000  mycontainer"

                       ( This creates a container file 'mycontainer' which
                         has 1000 * 5000 bytes of storage capacity ).


             ( In Linux, lolfs may be used directly with removable storage,
               without warranty of course!

               So, you may actually insert an SDHC card to your Linux
               and create a lol storage directly there. In that case the
               "filename" parameter is just the name of the device,
               for example "mkfs.lolfs 512 4000000 /dev/sdb"
               You MUST know what you are doing then, and of course
               you must be root to do that - or anything similar.
               You have been warned! :)


lol program:
============

            The "lol" app has a couple of built-in functions which
            can be used to do some common file tasks.
            These functions are currently (in v 0.12) :

            - ls
            - cp
            - rm
            - df
            - cat

            For example, if you want to list all the files
            inside a container file "mycontainer", type:

            lol ls mycontainer

            So, use it like "lol ls mycontainer", where
            "mycontainer" is the name of the container file

            lol cp function:
            ---------------

            lol cp copies files to (and from) your container file.

             If you want to copy a file /home/you/readme.txt to your
             container file 'mycontainer', use:
             lol cp /home/you/readme.txt mycontainer

             If you want to copy a file which is inside the container
             back to your normal filesystem, use:

             lol cp mycontainer:/readme.txt /some/directory

             NOTE: When accessing files inside your container, you must
                   separate the path with ':' like in above example.


             lol rm function:
             ---------------

            lol rm   deletes a file from your container file.
                     Use like: "lol rm mycontainer:/readme.txt"

             NOTE:   Note also here (this is common feature when accessing
                     files inside a container), that you must separate
                     the file with a ':' from it's container.


             lol df function:
             ---------------

             lol df  Shows how much space is used in container file.
                     Use like: "lol df mycontainer"


             lol cat function:
             ----------------

             lol cat  Prints the contents of a file (inside a container)
                      to standard output.
                      Use like: "lol cat mycontainer:/readme.txt"
                      Or like: "lol cat mycontainer:/somefile &gt; somefile.bak"

<a id="lolfs-api" class="anchor" href="#lolfs-api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>lolfs API:</h1>

<pre><code> The API functions are explained in &lt;lolfs.h&gt;
 They are identical to their standard C counterparts,
 except the "lol_" prefix in the name:

 - For example use "lol_fopen" to open a file inside
   your container, it returns a lol_FILE* handle which
   may then be used to lol_fread, lol_fwrite, lol_fseek etc..

 - when you lol_fopen a file (or otherwise manipulate files inside
   a container file, you must separate the filesystem path from the
   file inside a container with a ':'

 Example: Create a file "test.txt" inside container called 'mycontainer'.
</code></pre>

<p>#include 
  #include </p>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>         lol_FILE *fp;
         char text[] = "Hello World!\n";

         fp = lol_fopen("mycontainer:/test.txt", "w");

         lol_fwrite((char *)text, strlen(text), 1, fp);
         lol_fclose(fp);
         return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>How to compile and link a lolfs enabled program:</p>

<p>gcc program.c -o program -llolfs</p>

<p>(You may need to include compiler option -L/path/to/librarydir
   if the linker does not find lolfs library)</p>
